# 📰 Targeted News Monitoring Pipeline

A Python pipeline that uses web scraping and LLMs to monitor news events based on a certain risk type. The system is designed to allow analysts to detect emerging risks such as supply chain disruptions, regulatory changes or geopolitical events more efficiently. It is particularly useful in emerging markets with many non-English sources because LLMs are excellent at simultaneously translating and summarizing raw news content. 

**Key technologies:** Python, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, LLM APIs (Gemini), prompt engineering.


## 🔍 Overview

The pipeline performs the following steps:

1. Scrapes headlines from multiple news listing pages
2. Uses an LLM to identify risk-relevant headlines
3. Scrapes full article texts for the flagged stories
4. Uses a two-stage LLM summarisation process to generate a final summary

This approach allows large volumes of news to be processed efficiently while focusing only on stories relevant to a specific risk type.


## ⚙️ Customization

New monitoring can be customised based on:

- Entity of concern (e.g. a logistics firm operating in Colombia)
- Risk type (e.g. transport disruption events)
- Confidence rate (e.g. 95%)

A variety of other parameters such as batch size, model type, retry attempts and more can also be adjusted.

## 📐 Architectural Decisions


- **Batch headline identification:** The scraped headlines are evaluated in batches using a lightweight LLM to improve efficiency. Headlines are joined together and separated by index numbers. The LLM is then asked to return only the indices of potential risk stories as a Python-style list.

- **Two-stage LLM summarisation:** The scraped story text undergoes multiple rounds of summarisation to improve relevance. The story text is batched and summarised using a lightweight LLM. An advanced LLM is then asked to use judgement to produce a concise summary of the summaries.
